# hello-world

I’m a cold & intense gatherer of information & impressions,
accused by Gladwell of often being the first to pick up on new or nascent trends.  
Some say, according to network theory and sociology, a maven is someone who has a disproportionate influence on other members of the
network.
I don’t know that to be truth - after all it’s just theory.
I do know my role as a maven;  propagating knowledge and preferences in various established social domains.
